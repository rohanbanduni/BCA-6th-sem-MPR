# PlantCare - Plant Disease Classification

## Overview

PlantCare is a machine learning-powered application designed to help identify and classify plant diseases from leaf images. This project was developed as part of our BCA 6th semester Major Project Report (MPR). Our aim is to assist farmers, agronomists, and gardeners in early detection and effective management of plant diseases.

## Features

- **Disease Identification:** Uses machine learning models to classify various plant diseases.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Developed with Streamlit for easy navigation and use.
- **Open Source:** Code and resources are available on GitHub for further development and collaboration.

## How It Works

Using machine learning algorithms, PlantCare analyzes images of plant leaves to identify symptoms associated with different plant diseases. Users can simply upload a clear photo of the affected plant, and the classifier will quickly provide a diagnosis.

## Tech Stack

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Machine Learning Framework:** TensorFlow
- **Web Framework:** Streamlit

## Usage

1. **Upload an Image:** Navigate to the app and upload a clear image of the plant leaf.
2. **Get Results:** The app will process the image and provide a diagnosis of the plant disease.
